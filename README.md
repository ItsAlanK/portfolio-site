# ItsAlanK React based Portfolio Site

I had to do it eventually so I'm committing to it now. Site is going to be largely React based and serve as a hub for my projects coding and otherwise _(More of them on the to do list too)_

Starting palette coming from current CV, want to have more pastel final look so will mute colors somewhat.

- Like off white BG
- Yellow could work if a bit more orange for cinematic look and softer for pastel
- Soften green to match orange/yellow
- Dark grey with slight purple/pink warmth v nice
- Almost black purple could maybe be pushed closer to black
